They represent the thousands of employees across the nation who are of service to the landless farmers.
                The couple usually sports a baseball cap, unbuttoned shirts over long-sleeved tees, and a pair of boots. But they are never seen without a stalk of rice grains pinned on their ears, a reminder of their commitment to serve the agrarian reform beneficiaries.
